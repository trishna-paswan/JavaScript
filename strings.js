const name = "hitesh"
const repoCount = 10

console.log(`Hello, my name is ${name} and I have ${repoCount} repositories.`); 
// more reliable way to do this (string interpolation)

console.log("Hello, my name is " + name + " and I have " + repoCount + " repositories.");
// less reliable way to do this (string concatenation)
